### Sections on Report Guidelines

#### Impact Highlights
- Use the **Positive Impact Level Rubric** and the **Positive Pattern Detection Guidance** rubrics as internal guidance for analysis
- Only surface recurring patterns internally rated Impact Level 3 to 5. Do not reference these numbers in the final output.
- Do **NOT** display impact level numbers or rubric names (e.g., "Level 3") in the final report. Use descriptive labels ("Reliable", "Trusted", or "Inspiring") **only in plain English**, and only when appropriate.
- For every issue in the **Impact Highlights** section:
  - Clearly explain **why the pattern qualifies as recurring** (e.g., "seen 3 times across retros")
  - Reflect not just on **what was achieved**, but **how it was achieved** (clarity, ownership, collaboration).
  - Focus on **specific, observable moments** where {team_member} created value for the team or project.
  - Provide **proof of at least 3 separate instances**
  - Use direct quotes, task IDs, timestamps, or meeting references
  - Do not include isolated or resolved issues

#### Gaps and Growth Areas
- Use the **Severity Level Rubric** and the **Negative Pattern Detection Guidance** rubrics as internal guidance for analysis
- Only surface recurring patterns internally rated Severity 3 to 5. Do not reference these numbers in the final output.  
- Do **NOT** display severity numbers or rubric names (e.g., “Severity 3”) in the final report. Use descriptive labels (“Moderate”, “High”, or “Critical”) **only in plain English**, and only when appropriate.  
- For every issue in the **Gaps & Growth** section:
  - Clearly explain **why the pattern qualifies as recurring** (e.g., “seen 3 times across retros”)
  - Provide **proof of at least 3 separate instances**
  - Use direct quotes, task IDs, timestamps, or meeting references
  - Do not include isolated or resolved issues

## 📄 OUTPUT: Report Structure

---

### 🌟 Impact Highlights

Identify and describe **standout contributions** made by **{team_member}** during **{date_range}**, with a focus on how those contributions created **visible value** for the team or project.

Instructions:
- Reflect not only on **what was achieved**, but **how** it was achieved.
- Emphasize examples of **collaboration**, **technical strengths**, and **support provided to others**.
- Only include factual, observable outcomes—avoid speculation.

Use the following **reflection questions** to guide evidence extraction across Daily Updates, JIRA, and transcripts:
- Did the teammate help **unblock** anyone? How?
- Were they instrumental in **resolving key issues or bugs**?
- Did they **share or document anything** that improved team understanding or onboarding?
- Did they **refactor**, **optimize**, or **scale** any part of the system?
- Were they involved in any **calls, decisions, or async threads** that moved a project forward?
- Did they **proactively identify gaps** or **suggest improvements**?
- Who **benefited** from their action — directly or indirectly?
- How did their action affect **trust, speed, stress**, or **clarity** on the team?

Present your findings as a **markdown-formatted list**, where each item captures a single impact highlight. Use the structure below for each item:

#### **Positive Behavior Observed**: Name the standout behavior or habit (e.g., proactive handoff updates, offering guidance to peers, sharing blockers with options).
  - **Impact Level**: The impact level description of the issue (e.g., Reliable / Uplifting, Trusted / High Impact, or Inspiring / Teamwide Influence).
  - **Frequency**: How often this was observed (e.g., "3 instances across sprint reports and check-ins").
  - **Evidences**: Up to 3 direct quotes, paraphrased examples, or observable actions that illustrate the behavior.
  - **How It Was Achieved**: Describe the specific actions, habits, or decisions that led to the behavior (e.g., set reminders, followed through without prompts, created a checklist).
  - **Strengths Shown**: Name relevant strengths (e.g., Ownership, Clear Communication, Mentorship, Collaboration).
  - **Team Impact**: Explain how it helped the team move faster, coordinate better, reduce stress, or increase trust.
  - **Who Benefited**: Identify teammates, roles, or sub-teams that received value — or leave blank if unknown.
  - **Why It Mattered**: Connect the impact to project outcomes, progress, or team health (e.g., "kept project unblocked", "helped newer teammate contribute sooner").
  - **Reinforcement Action**: Suggest what a manager could do to amplify the strength (e.g., public recognition, offer scope increase, encourage sharing in retro, use it as a model).
Be concise but specific. Each row should capture a unique instance of value creation or collaboration.

### ⚠️ Gaps & Growth Areas

Highlight any **recurring**, **unresolved**, or **high-severity** challenges that were directly attributable to **{team_member}** during **{date_range}**.

This section is designed to support **constructive growth**, not evaluation or blame. Use it to help **{manager}** understand the team member's current struggles so they can offer the right support, realignment, or enablement.

If no significant concerns were identified, explicitly state:

> _"No performance concerns were identified during this period. {team_member}'s work aligns well with expectations. Recommend maintaining current consistency, visibility, and proactive engagement to sustain impact."_

DO NOT include, mention, or refer to severity ratings in the report. 

For any meaningful issue found, present your findings as a **markdown-formatted list**. Use the structure below for each item:

- **Issue Observed**: Clearly name the pattern or problem behavior (e.g., missed follow-through on tickets, unclear async updates, resistance to feedback).
  - **Level**: The severity level description of the issue (e.g., Moderate / Coaching-Worthy, High / Delivery-Impacting, or Critical / Systemic Risk).
  - **Recurrence**: How many times (e.g., “seen 3 times across retros”)
  - **Evidences**: Up to 3 direct quotes, paraphrased examples, or observable actions that illustrate the behavior.
  - **Cause**: Identify the likely root factor (e.g., skill gap, misalignment of priorities, communication breakdown, mindset).
  - **Impact**: Explain how this affected team performance, delivery velocity, quality, morale, or stakeholder trust.
  - **Manager Action**: Suggest how the manager can help — whether through coaching, clarity, additional structure, or delegation.

Keep tone neutral and developmental. Prioritize clarity and accountability.
