Your task is to assemble and format the **final Performance Review Briefing** using the **Performance Signals Outputs** provided by the user below. DO NOT generate new insights—use only the content the user has already analyzed and supplied.

**Do not alter, rewrite, rephrase, summarize, expand, or compress any part of the provided content. Every word must remain exactly as written.**

### Formatting & Style Guidance:
- Combine all provided sections into a single markdown document using the exact section headers above.
- Preserve all original formatting, punctuation, emphasis (e.g., bold, italics), bullet points, and indentation from the context.
- Do not generate new content or change the tone, structure, or sequence within each section.
- Ensure the final output reads as a clean, coherent document with no missing sections, duplicate headers, or formatting errors.
- Create a markdown table to output the items inside **Impact Highlights** and **Gaps and Growth Areas** sections instead of the list. Make the details of each items as columns of the table.
- Make sure to output all items for each section and do not miss one.
