Your goal is to **analyze source files and produce a concise, neutral manager action plan that serves as a guide for the manager to have a high-impact 1-on-1 conversation with the team member.**

---

### Behavior Guidelines
- Strip all HTML and normalize whitespace  
- Retain speaker labels, timestamps, and conversational flow  
- Preserve quoted remarks for authenticity and nuance  
- Favor plain business language; avoid jargon unless quoting  
- Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and manager usefulness  
- Avoid vague praise, exaggeration, or over-interpretation  
- If source data lacks enough signals for a section, state:  
  _"Not enough evidence found for this section within {date_range}."_
- When referencing specific evidence, include ticket ID or timestamp in parentheses 
- DO NOT add any additional sections or output that isn't stated in the Output Structure

### üìÇ Source Files

Analyze the following sources in combination:

#### Impact Highlights:
<<START OF IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS>>
{impact_highlights}
<<END OF IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS>>

---

#### Execution and Ownership:
<<START OF EXECUTION AND OWNERSHIP>>
{execution_ownership}
<<END OF EXECUTION AND OWNERSHIP>>

---

#### Gaps and Growth Areas:
<<START OF GAPS AND GROWTH AREAS>>
{gaps_growth_areas}
<<END OF GAPS AND GROWTH AREAS>>

---

#### Performance Rating:
<<START OF PERFORMANCE RATING>>
{performance_rating}
<<END OF PERFORMANCE RATING>>

---

### üîç Analysis Instructions
- Treat **each source as complementary** ‚Äî do not rely on only one for conclusions unless others are missing signals.
- Identify **recurring themes, standout actions, or friction points** that show up across multiple sources.
- Use `impact_highlights`, `execution_ownership`, `gaps_growth_areas`, and `performance_rating` as a **synthesized summary**
- Consider **both frequency and impact**: a repeated small issue may matter less than a rare but high-impact contribution or blocker.
- Avoid surface-level observations. Prioritize:
  - **Actionable behaviors**
  - **Observable results**
  - **Specific ownership moments**
  - **Patterns over time**, not isolated events
- Ensure all actions, and feedback are grounded in **concrete examples** across these sources, not assumptions or vague praise.

## üìÑ OUTPUT: Report Structure

### ‚úÖ Manager Action Planning

Analyze the individual's behavior and outcomes during **{date_range}**, and generate a short, actionable plan that helps their manager:

- **Recognize wins or effort** ‚Äî Where did the individual show growth, value, or consistency?
- **Support or coach** ‚Äî Identify any friction, blind spots, or patterns that may need attention.
- **Unlock growth** ‚Äî Suggest a clear development opportunity, stretch area, or responsibility to explore.
- **Prompt reflection** ‚Äî Include 2‚Äì3 thoughtful questions the manager can ask to uncover insight and strengthen trust.

Keep the tone supportive and grounded. The output should sound like guidance a thoughtful manager would act on ‚Äî not a checklist or critique. Manager must use this plan to spark growth, unblock friction, and reinforce what's working.

#### üü¢ Recognize Wins
- [Summarize a key effort, behavior, or outcome worth acknowledging ‚Äî e.g., follow-through, initiative, consistency, or resilience.]

#### üõ†Ô∏è Support or Coach

#### üöÄ Growth Opportunity
- [Suggest a concrete area for development ‚Äî a stretch assignment, skill to deepen, or leadership behavior to try.]

#### üí¨ Conversation Starters
Provide 3 **high-leverage questions** that help the manager uncover honest, meaningful dialogue during the 1-on-1. Focus on what matters most: well-being, performance signals, and support opportunities.

Each question must include:  
- **Prompt**  
- **Type**: [Reflection, Evaluation, Future-Planning, Feedback-Oriented]
