### üîç Executive Summary

**Harold Inacay** delivered steady, high-value backend engineering performance for EngagePath during April‚ÄìJune 2025, with clear signals of ownership, technical depth, and collaborative reliability. He consistently took responsibility for core backend data ingestion and processing‚Äîespecially for LinkedIn connection requests, followers, following, posts, and message syncing‚Äîplaying a central role in both planned feature delivery and emergent bug resolution.

**Ownership & Delivery:**  
Harold was a dependable anchor for backend work, frequently volunteering for complex or ambiguous tasks and following through to completion. He led the implementation and testing of LinkedIn connection request ingestion (including invite message handling and pagination, e.g., CSMVP-412, CSMVP-443, daily updates 5/28, 6/4, 6/11), and was instrumental in migrating and optimizing the processing of connections, followers, and posts to the new service bus architecture (Fathom 6/25, 6/26). He reliably closed out assigned backend tickets and bug fixes, often ahead of or in sync with sprint goals.

**Communication & Collaboration:**  
Harold demonstrated strong cross-functional collaboration, supporting JM and Christian with API endpoints, data model changes, and technical clarifications (Fathom 6/24‚Äì6/26). He participated actively in sprint planning, ticket breakdowns, and integration discussions, helping to clarify backend/frontend boundaries and unblock others. He was responsive to feedback, coordinated on integration points, and contributed to team alignment during architectural changes.

**Self-Management & Adaptability:**  
Harold adapted quickly to new requirements and architectural patterns, such as the service bus migration and new message syncing features (JIRA CSMVP-537, CSMVP-538, Fathom 6/25). He communicated progress and blockers in daily standups and async channels, and was proactive in surfacing technical risks and adapting to shifting priorities.

---

**Standout Contribution:**  
A key highlight was Harold‚Äôs leadership in migrating backend data processing (connections, followers, posts) to the new service bus model (Fathom 6/25, 6/26). This migration was critical for system scalability and reliability, and Harold‚Äôs initiative and technical depth enabled the team to deliver new engagement features and reduce ambiguity around backend data flows. His work directly unblocked frontend and product teams, supporting the successful delivery of Vision 1 and Vision 2 milestones.

---

**Area for Attention:**  
The main recurring growth area observed was around **proactive communication of blockers and documentation of backend changes**. There were several instances where blockers, ambiguous requirements, or ticket ownership needed more explicit surfacing or clarification (Fathom 6/24‚Äì6/26). Occasional uncertainty in cross-functional planning and limited documentation led to minor friction or rework, especially as the team scaled and architectural complexity increased. While these gaps did not materially impact delivery, supporting Harold in developing lightweight documentation habits and encouraging early, explicit communication of blockers or ambiguities will help prevent misalignment and ensure smoother handoffs as the team grows.

---

**Summary for Cleo:**  
Harold has been a steady, high-value backend contributor, especially during architectural migration and new feature rollouts. His technical depth and collaborative approach have enabled the team to deliver on key milestones and adapt to change. To unlock further growth and reduce friction as the team scales, support Harold in developing more proactive communication and documentation habits, and consider giving him opportunities to lead technical documentation or integration efforts. No major concerns exist regarding reliability or engagement; the focus is on supporting his continued growth as the team and product mature.
