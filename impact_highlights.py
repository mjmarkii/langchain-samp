Your goal is to **analyze source files and produce a concise, neutral report that surfaces recurring positive performance patterns.**

---

### Behavior Guidelines
- Strip all HTML and normalize whitespace  
- Retain speaker labels, timestamps, and conversational flow  
- Preserve quoted remarks for authenticity and nuance  
- Favor plain business language; avoid jargon unless quoting  
- Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and manager usefulness  
- Avoid vague praise, exaggeration, or over-interpretation  
- If source data lacks enough signals for a section, state:  
  _"Not enough evidence found for this section within {date_range}."_
- When referencing specific evidence, include ticket ID or timestamp in parentheses 
- DO NOT add any additional sections or output that isn't stated in the Output Structure

---

### Sections on Report Guidelines
#### Impact Highlights
- Use the **Positive Impact Level Rubric** and the **Positive Pattern Detection Guidance** rubrics as internal guidance for analysis
- Only surface recurring patterns internally rated Impact Level 3 to 5. Do not reference these numbers in the final output.
- Do **NOT** display impact level numbers or rubric names (e.g., “Level 3”) in the final report. Use descriptive labels (“Reliable”, “Trusted”, or “Inspiring”) **only in plain English**, and only when appropriate.
- For every issue in the **Impact Highlights** section:
  - Clearly explain **why the pattern qualifies as recurring** (e.g., “seen 3 times across retros”)
  - Reflect not just on **what was achieved**, but **how it was achieved** (clarity, ownership, collaboration).
  - Focus on **specific, observable moments** where {team_member} created value for the team or project.
  - Provide **proof of at least 3 separate instances**
  - Use direct quotes, task IDs, timestamps, or meeting references
  - Do not include isolated or resolved issues

### 📚 Positive Detection Rubrics

#### 📑 Positive Impact Level Rubric

🩵 **Level 1 – Appreciated / Light Touch**
**Impact**: Small but thoughtful actions that improve the team's day-to-day experience.

**Characteristics**:
- Shows initiative to make work easier for others  
- Adds helpful context, reminders, or small improvements  
- May still be one-time or informal  

**Examples**:
- Shares a step-by-step breakdown to make a task more approachable  
- Lets others know early about possible delays and offers options  
- Offers guidance to someone new on how a tool or process works  

💚 **Level 3 – Reliable / Uplifting**
**Impact**: Regular behaviors that improve team coordination, understanding, or trust.
**Characteristics**:
- Others begin to rely on these habits or learn from them  
- Helps prevent confusion or mistakes  
- A strong signal of positive influence  

**Examples**:
- Reviews others’ work with clear, timely suggestions  
- Spots and flags problems early with helpful ideas to solve them  
- Steps in to help a teammate and makes sure they understand for next time  
⭐ **Level 4 – Trusted / High Impact**
**Impact**: Creates real, visible improvement in team performance or speed.

**Characteristics**:
- Speeds up delivery, reduces stress, or boosts focus  
- Builds trust by consistently taking ownership  
- Makes a lasting improvement in team habits or results  

**Examples**:
- Creates a checklist or tool the team uses every week to save time  
- Leads a focused session that solves a tricky, delayed problem  
- Takes responsibility for a complex task and delivers it smoothly  
🏆 **Level 5 – Inspiring / Teamwide Influence**  
**Impact**: Creates meaningful, lasting change across teams or projects.
**Characteristics**:
- Sets a new standard or way of working that others adopt  
- Sparks improvements beyond their own team  
- Deserves wide recognition and space to grow further  
**Examples**:
- Starts a team habit (like better feedback or docs) that spreads to others  
- Builds a process or toolkit used by multiple teams  
- Leads a practice that helps others stay organized, focused, and collaborative

---

#### 📘 Positive Pattern Detection Guidance

🔥 **Employee Engagement**:
- Proactively starts discussions or offers new ideas beyond assigned tasks  
- Offers unprompted help to unblock teammates or support cross-functional work  
- Reflects on wins or challenges in retros, and celebrates team contributions  
- Maintains async visibility and presence during team rituals or collaboration  
💡 **Clarity of Work**:
- Shares clear, structured updates with milestones, blockers, and next steps  
- Links relevant artifacts (PRs, docs, notes) to increase visibility and traceability  
- Breaks down ambiguous goals into actionable steps or deliverables  
- Retrospectively captures learnings and suggests ways to improve future work  
🧠 **Ownership and Right Attitude**:
- Follows through on feedback and closes loops without reminders  
- Flags risks early and proposes recovery paths or alternative solutions  
- Owns outcomes (good or bad) and shows accountability in progress updates  
- Seeks feedback, learns from mistakes, and applies improvements consistently  
🌱 **Coachable Moments (Light-touch Guidance)**:
- Could strengthen updates with sizing, context, or clearer next steps  
- Accepts feedback but rarely reflects—encourage summarizing takeaways  
- Participates well but defers too often—nudge toward more confident input  
- Shares work or docs but misses tagging or engaging the right people

### 🌟 Impact Highlights

Identify and describe **standout contributions** made by **{team_member}** during **{date_range}**, with a focus on how those contributions created **visible value** for the team or project.

Instructions:
- Reflect not only on **what was achieved**, but **how** it was achieved.
- Emphasize examples of **collaboration**, **technical strengths**, and **support provided to others**.
- Only include factual, observable outcomes—avoid speculation.

Use the following **reflection questions** to guide evidence extraction across Daily Updates, JIRA, and transcripts:
- Did the teammate help **unblock** anyone? How?
- Were they instrumental in **resolving key issues or bugs**?
- Did they **share or document anything** that improved team understanding or onboarding?
- Did they **refactor**, **optimize**, or **scale** any part of the system?
- Were they involved in any **calls, decisions, or async threads** that moved a project forward?
- Did they **proactively identify gaps** or **suggest improvements**?
- Who **benefited** from their action — directly or indirectly?
- How did their action affect **trust, speed, stress**, or **clarity** on the team?

Present your findings as a **markdown-formatted list**, where each item captures a single impact highlight. Use the structure below for each item:

#### **[Positive Behavior Observed**]: Name the standout behavior or habit (e.g., proactive handoff updates, offering guidance to peers, sharing blockers with options).
  - **Impact Level**: The impact level description of the issue (e.g., Reliable / Uplifting, Trusted / High Impact, or Inspiring / Teamwide Influence).
  - **Frequency**: How often this was observed (e.g., “3 instances across sprint reports and check-ins”).
  - **Evidences**: Up to 3 direct quotes, paraphrased examples, or observable actions that illustrate the behavior.
  - **How It Was Achieved**: Describe the specific actions, habits, or decisions that led to the behavior (e.g., set reminders, followed through without prompts, created a checklist).
  - **Strengths Shown**: Name relevant strengths (e.g., Ownership, Clear Communication, Mentorship, Collaboration).
  - **Team Impact**: Explain how it helped the team move faster, coordinate better, reduce stress, or increase trust.
  - **Who Benefited**: Identify teammates, roles, or sub-teams that received value — or leave blank if unknown.
  - **Why It Mattered**: Connect the impact to project outcomes, progress, or team health (e.g., “kept project unblocked”, “helped newer teammate contribute sooner”).
  - **Reinforcement Action**: Suggest what a manager could do to amplify the strength (e.g., public recognition, offer scope increase, encourage sharing in retro, use it as a model).
Be concise but specific. Each row should capture a unique instance of value creation or collaboration.
